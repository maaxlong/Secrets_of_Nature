The life cycles of the Hover Fly and the Drone Fly each of which is useful to man. The Hover Fly, which is similar in appearance to the bee, lays its eggs among other insects - in this case, the Black Fly which lives on the broad bean plant. When the grubs hatch, they feed on the parasitic Black flies around them (218). When the grub has reached its full growth, it becomes a cocoon (250), emerging after about a month as an adult insect (270). The Drone Fly, a cousin of the Hover Fly, prevents pools of decaying vegetation from becoming poisonous. The female lays her eggs in the mud surrounding these pools (368). The newly-hatched grubs make for the water where they eat all the floating rubbish (455). When this is all gone, the grubs burrow down into the mud at the bottom of the pool, and begin to eat that too. They get air by means of a hollow 'tail' which reaches to the surface of the water (498). If the grubs are frightened, they can contact these tubes until the danger is past (570). The grubs can swim by contracting and expanding the skin near their heads and they also have legs on which they can travel along the bottom of the pool (620). These legs enable them to get back onto the land. Here they bury themselves in the mud and turn into cocoons (703). The adult insect emerges after about 4 days (800 ft).

A speeded-up look at the hop's growth, pushing its way through the soil (99). A close-up of the stem, showing its ""claws"" (106). The expansion of the leaves speeded up 25000 times (122). A look at the plant as it begins to climb and it is shown that the claws are used for gripping (167). The hop then starts to put out flowers. The flowers of the male hop are shown (195). The flowers of the female hop. Each one is a ball of scales with sticky threads to catch pollen. However, the threads wither and fall away as there is no pollen in the vicinity. The scales, though, continue to grow as a protective device for the seeds which are not there. They become covered with a sticky substance called luculin (287). A magnification of luculin. It is this that gives beer its flavour (302). Hops maturing in the hop garden (312). Shot of barley ripening in a field. Barley is the second ingredient necessary for beer (323). Barley seeds provide the malt. They are placed in water until as much as possible has been absorbed (342). They are put in layers in a warm atmosphere where they begin to put out roots. This is magnified 10000 times. The maltster turns them upside down to make sure that they do not grow too quickly. They have to change the direction of their roots. Suddenly the water supply is cut off and the roots wither and die (432). A diagram of a grain of barley which is seen to be in three parts - (1) the young plant (2) the starch store above (3) a wall between the two through which the starch cannot pass. To get at the starch the plant produces a digestive fluid which penetrates the wall and turns the starch into sugar which feeds the plant (492). There is a certain point when fluid has been produced but the sugar has not yet been used by the plant. It is at this point that the maltster kills the plant (511). The grains are mashed up in warm water. The digestive fluid continues to turn starch into sugar. This mixture is malt (533). The brewery where the malt is mixed with the hops liquid and yeast is added (550). Yeast cells under a microscope compared with a human hair (571). The yeast cells move when put into water. The cells grow in the sugary mixture and when they reach a certain size, new cells form. This is called fermentation (645).
